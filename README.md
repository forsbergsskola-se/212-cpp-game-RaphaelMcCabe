## Dog Game C++ Project
This game is a SDL project made in order to teach us the basics of c++ game development. My game is a text based writing game where
you guess what animal is on the screen. Currently there is only one animal implemented but implementing more animals in the future 
will be simple. 

## Design Pattern
The design pattern I used to create my game is a game loop. I created functions that started the gameplay 
and reset it whenever I pressed certain keys and I also kept track if the player had won.

## Advanced c++ features
I made use of collections in my game including strings and truetype fonts in my game.
I used strings in order to use truetype fonts so that I could render text in the screen.
The truetype font strings are used to explain to the player the core gameplay and it is
also used when the player inputs key presses.
